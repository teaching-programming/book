## Introduction

Recent advances in computing allow engineers to use programming more efficiently in their routine tasks. 
Specifically, students in civil engineering branch (CivEng) have rather firm concept of domain problem 
and considerable skills in problem solving with the capability of computing. However, the reality 
is far from job done: translating their manual-solving skill to computer code is non-trivial. 
In order to do so, they have to change their mindset to produce code that they can reuse and benefit others as well.

This article presents some of my experience in guiding two classes: one with Python and one with Julia. 
In both classes I focused on the practical aspect of solving a typical engineering problem — 
calculating the flux of sediment in natural waterbodies (e.g. lakes, rivers) — rather than 
delving into merits of the two languages nor making any comparison between them.

## Code Implementation

### Logic of calculation

CivEng students generally do not encounter any difficulty in implementing a series of formulae in order, 
as well as translating formula to code. For example, in the snippet below, the drag coefficient 
is readily calculated according to the math equation

...

CivEng students are well aware of complex engineering formulas and would be willing to write lengthy statements 
for mathematical expressions. Furthermore, they have adopted the style of naming variables according to 
the symbolic representation which is widely agreed in the literature. 

A branching construction would not cause much difficulty, this time is to calculate the critical flow velocity. 
The CivEng student surely does not confuse with units:

...

The implementation of a mass-conservation equation should not cause too much problem. Here the naive implementation 
of using a nested list to emulate a 2-D array, which doesn’t seem much performant. But that’s enough for the CivEng 
who wants to get the job done.

...

The use of matrix operations would involve broadcasting and but with gain in performance, usually quoted as 
some 10 times (Langtangen 2008). Fortunately, the disadvantage can be overcome with Julia programming. 
Really, if you were to consider the stencil involved (figure below, where the arrows denote subtraction), 
the code is more transparent when using an index system with (i±1). When using matrix manipulation, the bounds 
must be specified correctly in all matrix subscripts. 

...

Another source of confusion is due to the concept of “views” in NumPy, for which the submatrix, e.g. 
`dqxdx[1:][:]` in the snippet above, is a copy of the array `dqxdx`. Surely, this can be explained 
to the students, but every such issue can add up and discourage the learners. Therefore, an “agreement” 
might be made beforehand, that the matrix qx here is calculated once and cannot be modified thereafter. 
Or else, you have to switch to another programming language, e.g. MATLAB.

### Dimension and units in civil engineering

A particular strength of the CivEng student is having keen eyes on physical quantities. The branching statement 
presented above show that the student was aware of units and apply corresponding coefficients. The ability 
to tell the meaning from numbers allow them to check intermediate results and correct potential errors 
during computation. Another advantage is that by adhering to the rules of dimensions in physics, the student 
naturally familiarise themselves with the type system and therefore will not have much difficulties dealing 
with languages like C#, Java, Scala, or to go forward and write type annotations in their Python code.
