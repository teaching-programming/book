    "text": "3.2 What is “pair programming”? (and why should you care?)\nIn the software industry, people often work in pairs, which evolved over the years into a standard collaborative practice called “pair programming” (Williams 2010). Partners take turns playing two different roles: driver and navigator. The driver has exclusive control of the shared computer, and the navigator guides the driver by acting as their sounding board. Being in each role allows them to gain and contribute unique perspectives on the task at hand. Switching roles frequently allows both partners to get the most out of the experience.\n\n\n\n“I think your idea will work, let me type it in!”,” I see a bracket missing on line 7”, “Let’s run this code and see what happens.”, “Yay, we did it! It works!”\n\n\nThe purpose of the exercise is not only to produce better output (e.g., code) but also to: share knowledge and practice (cross-pollinate ideas); help each other to grow; create friendships and community; and foster a culture of being able to doubt and ask for help (you’re never struggling alone).\nIn the professional world, pair programming benefits the product, the individuals, and the team. When implemented in the classroom, students can reap those same benefits, with evidence of positive impact on learning experience and outcomes (Hanks et al. 2011).\nWe are a team of UoE educators who have been using pair programming as a group work protocol in our teaching for several years. We have done so across many subject areas (psychology, mathematics, statistics, data science, medicine, epidemiology, business, EFI); levels of study (UG and PGT); and delivery modalities (in person, online, hybrid). We have consistently seen the positive impact of this practice on our students and teaching teams.\nIn our view, the benefits come from the structured roles and the process, which are transferable to other production tasks beyond just writing code (Saltz and Heckman 2020). Indeed, any task where a group of people create an artifact (e.g., writing, weaving, drawing, problem-solving) could apply the same collaboration principles.",

    "section": "3.3 Structured roles for active learning",
    "text": "3.3 Structured roles for active learning\nGroup work can be beneficial to learning, but navigating group dynamics requires effort, which can significantly worsen the cognitive load of learning something new. When roles are vague (or non-existent), communicating and negotiating responsibilities between group members can become an extra task in itself. For instance, when no-one in a team feels individually responsible, everyone might wait for the others to take initiative, and nothing gets done; or, one student might assume a leadership role, leaving others who are less confident to follow passively or to disengage entirely.\nAs a structured way to work together (a “collaboration script” (Weinberger 2011)), pair programming gives groups a roadmap with prescribed roles for each student, and specific activities associated with each role. With the burden of inefficient group work lifted, students have more room to focus on learning. Furthermore, when clear roles are assigned, everyone has to take ownership of their part and actively contribute.\n\n“Making sure everyone takes turns being the driver means everyone needs to contribute.” - UG, Psychology\n\n\n\n\n“Hello! Which of you is driving now?”, “Is it time to switch drivers?”, “Do you need help getting unblocked or are you just cracking on?”\n\n\nAs a result, we see students engage more. They take responsibility for their group, attend more sessions, and come better prepared to not let their teammates down.\n\n“Students were not engaging in the tutorial sessions at the beginning, which made them less useful. But it improved after having pair programming” - PGT, Medical School\n\nHaving defined roles doesn’t leave room for any one student to take over the task or speak over others, as can sometimes happen in unstructured group work. This is particularly important as many of our students have experienced marginalisation, and hence feel less safe putting themselves forward.\n\n“This is sort of just a problem with sexism, but I have really disliked group working in the past because I’ve been put with people (boys) who completely disrespect my work. This is why I’m opposed to the forced group working. It’s better to work alone than be treated like that.” - UG, Mathematics\n\nAlthough the structured roles are not a magic bullet to prevent these issues, they can provide tools for both students and tutors to maintain a safer learning environment. One useful strategy is for tutors to casually check in with the groups, leading with the question: “who is the driver?”. This does two things: first, it is a temperature check of whether the collaboration is working well; second, it reinforces the expectation that students should stick to the script at all times, even after the tutor leaves.\n\n\n\n“What if I end up in a pair with someone who is mean, or much more advanced than me?”, “I’m uncomfortable in socially complex situations. Will I know what to say and do in a group…”, “Should I just always work with the same friend, or would I miss out on meeting new people, and learning new coding styles”\n\n\nIf a student is undermined by their partner, they can fall back on the script to reassert themselves as a valued contributor, or to communicate the issue with a tutor. This can reduce the emotional cost required to flag or confront bad behaviour directly, by giving both students and tutors a tool to defuse the situation.",

    "section": "3.4 Fostering peer learning and community",
    "text": "3.4 Fostering peer learning and community\nPair programming provides plenty of opportunities for peer learning. The driver has to verbalise their specific ideas and problems, discuss them with the navigator, and synthesise the outcomes of their discussion to “put things on paper” and advance the task. The navigator must be an active listener, observer, and helper, and can take the leading role in higher-level strategic thinking. Both students are exposed to each other’s approach, and learn from each other by cross-pollination.\n\n“The most useful part of [pair programming] is being able to collaborate with other classmates, which allows me to discover aspects I hadn’t noticed in my own work through the questions raised by others.” - PGT, Mathematics\n\n\n[A core learning outcome from the course was] Experience in pair programming and trying to explain concepts to another student. Sometimes it’s quite easy to “see” how you’d do something yourself, but actually explaining this instead of doing it is more difficult, so the online sessions were very useful to practice this . I also found it very valuable to see how others work and how they understand code differently.” - PGT, Medical School\n\nStudents also appreciate how discussing with a peer can generate new ideas. A pair programming environment is highly conducive to discussion, creating a free flow of ideas where the outcome is more than the sum of its parts. Since only one person can write things down, students must verbally negotiate a shared understanding of the agreed way forward.\n\n“We have different ideas, and co-operate with each other could generate more ideas.” - UG, Psychology\n\n\n“Group discussions often have unexpected results.” - UG, Psychology\n\n\n\n\n“So the way I understand it, is …”, “I see another way to solve this!”, “That’s cool! I never thought about it this way”\n\n\nAlthough the roles are asymmetrical at any particular point in time, taking turns ensures that all students benefit equitably from playing both roles over the course of a session or a semester.\n\n“The practice of being a driver and a navigator is very useful. These two different roles provide me with distinct perspectives on the code. When I’m the driver, I focus on how to complete the code, and when I’m the navigator, I gain insights into how my fellow students understand the code, which helps me learn new things.” - PGT, Mathematics\n\nBeyond direct benefits in the classroom, we have also seen pair programming help build a sense of community among students and enrich their personal life at university. Students build a network of peers that they can turn to for support later. This is especially critical in distance learning, where students do not have the opportunity to naturally meet peers (e.g., outside of class).\n\n“The group work is very helpful. Not only have I made new friends, but I now also have people that I can rely on when I need help. Group work has also made the individual workload seem much lighter and we get things done faster.” - UG, Psychology\n\n\n“[It] was nice to get some 1-1 interaction through the pair programming in what could have been an otherwise solitary course.” - PGT, Mathematics (delivered online in 2020/21)\n\nThere are many ways to assign students into pairs, which might influence the classroom experience and community building in different ways. For example, many students are more likely to attend class if they can work with the same friend each time, but this might mean that they miss out on meeting new people. Swapping partners each week will create a network of student-to-student connections which contributes to cohort building. Finally, stretching the definition of “pair” programming to groups of 3 or more (with a single driver) can also work well. Allowing for more navigators can create flexibility in terms of logistics (odd number of students), technological problems (connection issues in online teaching), student preferences, or accessibility.\n\n“It gives you the perfect opportunity to work with other people and make potential new friends.” - UG, Psychology\n\n\n“[about using PP on 4 different courses] Thank you for the interactive pair programming sessions [across the academic year], they made a big difference in creating a community of online learners.” - PGT, Medical School",

    "text": "3.5 Tackling issues as a community of practice\nMany of our students have experience of dysfunctional group work, where different group members have different priorities, expectations, or skills. Pair programming can exacerbate this issue, because each student is expected to contribute actively to the joint work, whether they are driver or navigator. Inevitably, pairs will occasionally be incompatible, in a way which can undermine the effectiveness of peer learning. For instance, a very wide gap in technical proficiency or level of preparation can make for a frustrating experience for both students, leading to disengagement and even resentment.\n\n“I fully agree with the idea of group working, but in practise it usually results in people being left behind by those who understand better […] and unfortunately in maths way too many people are mean and make the beginners feel really bad.” - UG, Mathematics\n\nAlthough the strategies discussed above can minimise this, there is no single correct solution. Whatever way you decide to implement groupwork, you will encounter issues, and your approach will need to be adapted to your discipline, classroom, or even cohort.\nWe have come together as a community of practice for mutual support. We have found it incredibly valuable as educators to discuss experiences, tackle challenges, and share examples of good practice.",

Young\\(^1\\)\n1 Authors contributed equally and are listed alphabetically.\nProgramming or coding anxiety is defined as ‘a psychological state engendered when a student experiences or expects to lose self-esteem in confronting a computing situation’ (Connolly, Murphy, and Moore 2009). Coding anxiety may be driven, in part, by other anxieties such as computer anxiety (Chua, Chen, and Wong 1999; Meinhardt-Injac and Skowronek 2022) or statistics anxiety ((Zeidner 1991), amongst others. One may assume that “digital natives” (Bennett, Maton, and Kervin 2008) experience a lower level of computer anxiety; this assumption may not naturally translate to coding anxiety (Nolan and Bergin 2016). Indeed, computer anxiety could be attributed to, for example, variable exposure to coding and an over-reliance on connected digital ecosystems during childhood (How’s Life for Children in the Digital Age? 2025). The attribution of coding anxiety, however, is a more nuanced issue. Different levels of coding anxiety for mathematics and biomedical undergraduate students exist (Miller and Pyper 2024), with the former finding coding to be more enjoyable, and hence having lower anxiety levels, than the latter. More broadly, student identity and background can also contribute to anxiety-linked barriers to learning, such as gender (Forrester et al. 2022) or learning in a non-native language (Kaur and Newell 2024).\nGiven that coding anxiety can be attributed to a variety of sources (PAN and Harun 2025), here we draw on our collective experience of teaching coding, provide perspectives on coding anxiety, and offer strategies to mitigate it. We focus specifically on students for whom coding is not their core academic focus, but rather a necessary tool encountered when taking classes involving statistics, data analysis, experimental design, and modelling. It is possible that these students have had no prior exposure to coding, and their initial interactions will define their longer-term relationship with coding, and as a consequence, how they navigate an increasingly data-centric world where coding is an attractive, liberating, and increasingly essential skill.",

    "section": "5.2 Recognising and Refocusing Anxiety",
    "text": "5.2 Recognising and Refocusing Anxiety\nAnxiety sustains itself through a self-perpetuating cycle (Mkrtchian et al. 2017). It is believed to start with a trigger (e.g., a bad experience), which leads one to avoid future associated triggers in an attempt to feel some short-term relief (Hofmann and Hay 2018). However, such avoidance can lead to heightened anxiety in the long term (Mkrtchian et al. 2017). Since the brain learns that avoidance temporarily decreases anxiety, even if only momentarily, it may eventually prevent an individual from engaging with the trigger entirely. If the trigger is computer code, then coding becomes something to avoid, and hence coding anxiety is born. In contrast, confronting the trigger can build confidence and reduce anxiety over time TODO: missing reference : Kampmannetal2019 ? .\nWe believe that recognising learners’ coding anxieties upfront is an important first step towards demystifying it. Once students realise that this is an identified problem common to many, rather than something affecting them alone, they are one step closer to overcoming it. Humour, including self-deprecating jokes, describing how, despite now being the teacher, you once suffered from coding anxiety, can go a long way towards making students feel better. Cartoons may also be an effective way of making anxiety itself less daunting (Figure 1). If existing online content is not enough, and making cartoons is not one’s gift, AI-generated images could easily be created for that purpose - just make sure people have 5 fingers!\n\n\n\nFigure 1 - An example of a humorous cartoon that normalises coding anxiety (https://www.thesquarecomics.com/)\n\n\nGiven anxiety’s negative feedback loop, the best way to combat anxiety might be to break this vicious cycle (Figure 2). As an instructor or teacher, this can be achieved by providing positive experiences with coding. Importantly, after acknowledging that coding anxiety is real, the solutions should be presented along with how, as a teacher, overcoming their anxiety will be supported. For example, reflecting on their personal experience, the teacher could describe how they became at ease with coding. Such a role model could serve as a powerful catalyst for students to realise they can overcome their own coding anxiety too.\n\n\n\nFigure 2. The cycle of anxiety. Coding is identified as the trigger and the teacher serves as a diffuser to intervene in multiple places and in multiple ways to break the cycle. Adapted from https://www.mentalyc.com/\n\n\nGauging the class’s perception towards coding should prove useful in lowering overall anxiety. Collecting information about a priori fears or causes of anxiety related to one’s course, including - but not exclusively - coding anxiety, as well as course expectations, provides clues to what might be good strategies to adopt. In-class feedback tools like Mentimenter (www.mentimenter.com), allow students to provide feedback, anonymously and in real time, to make the course more accessible in an informal, friendly, and interactive way. This could generate useful ideas, including specific suggestions, for how to reduce anxiety. Additionally, having students reflect on how anxious they are about coding might allow them to identify shared problems and anxieties across the class.",

    "section": "5.3 Building Confidence Through Active Learning",
    "text": "5.3 Building Confidence Through Active Learning\nEarly hands-on activities involving code, but not necessarily creating their own code, could prove beneficial by focusing on the end product rather than the means to get there. Even exercises where students simply copy-paste code, without knowing why it does what it does (but being told that later they will be able to code it themselves), could go a long way in reducing anxiety. Such exercises allow students to see how useful coding is for tasks they would like to do, but which would be impossible to do manually. Focusing on the outcomes students are interested in and can relate to makes them less reluctant to learn programming than if they just see it as a barrier. For example, one could take a couple of large datasets linked by a common variable, and ask students to examine the files in a text editor and “understand” the data. Then the students can be given code to produce a captivating visualisation (Figure 3) with relevant insights for the subject matter of their course. Focusing on the reward, rather than the trigger, can lower anxiety (Xiao et al. 2022) and hopefully inspire students to create similar outputs themselves.\nTODO: missing image? please keep in mind naming convention\nFig. 3. Example of a beautiful visualisation created using R (a map of elephant movements through Kruger National Park). Produced by Dr Pratik Gupte (Imperial College London) and reused here with his permission.\nHaving fun reduces anxiety in a wide variety of contexts, so why not try it for coding anxiety, too? Coding need not be boring! There are many resources that one can use to showcase how coding can be fun. Having fun coding will mean that when coding becomes required, students’ receptivity to it is increased. R packages like memer and mermery allow meme creation from within R, while generative art packages can produce abstract paintings from code (Figure 4). The R package fun makes games and activities accessible from within the R environment. As an example, the classic game Minesweeper can be played within R via a single line of code defining the size of the area and the number of bombs. All the above can be used to introduce, in an informal setting, the concepts of functions and arguments. At the end of a long coding session, or even during one, package praise can also come in handy. A call to its single function praise() returns positive feedback like “You are wonderful!” or “You are supreme!”. These simple statements often put a smile on students’ faces, and based on our experience, that is halfway towards reducing anxiety. Finally, if students just can’t code but want to “fake it till they make it”, the R function look_busy() in the player package will produce output on the console that will make anyone else believe students are working hard. We have used several of these approaches and provide them as a starting point, but given R is a dynamic and ever-evolving environment, other fun and engaging options must live out there waiting to be used by teachers to help reduce code anxiety.\n\nFigure 4. Examples of how R coding can be fun. Top-left: A meme showcasing how memes can reduce code anxiety; this meme can be recreated with 2 lines of code using package “memer”. Top-right: A painting created in “aRtsy”, a generative art R package. Bottom-left: An instance of a minesweeper game created in package “fun”, demonstrating the authors inability to play it. Bottom-centre: An example of an animal that can be drawn in R syntax using the “cowsay” package. Bottom-right: The “CatterPlots” package can be used to generate scatterplots that include cats.\nLive coding can be one of the most effective tools to demystify programming and reduce coding anxiety. When teachers write and run code in real time, narrating their thought process as they go (and getting error messages), they model both the practice and the mindset of coding. Students witness that even experienced coders make mistakes, encounter errors, and debug them systematically. This transparency transforms coding from a mysterious, high-stakes activity into a visible process of exploration, reasoning, and iteration.\nImportantly, the approach taken during live coding matters as much as the content. Speaking aloud while typing, eg, explaining why particular commands are chosen, predicting outputs before running them, and pausing to invite student predictions, turns what might otherwise be a passive demonstration into an interactive learning experience. When an error appears, embrace it as an opportunity to model problem-solving, showing that mistakes are normal, and even useful. Seeing a tutor respond to an error message with curiosity rather than panic can profoundly reframe students’ emotional response to failure.\nTo lower anxiety further, live coding should begin with simple, visually rewarding tasks. Plot a small dataset, calculate a mean, or clean a short table. This way, students can follow the logic without feeling overwhelmed by syntax. Gradually, the exercises can build in complexity, moving from replication to modification and finally to creative application. When possible, students can be invited to suggest the next line of code, predict what will happen if a parameter is changed, or even take over the keyboard for short stretches.\nFinally, recording or providing annotated versions of live coding sessions allows students to revisit material at their own pace. This ensures that the spontaneity of live teaching is complemented by the reassurance of reviewable, structured notes. By combining openness, interaction, and a healthy acceptance of mistakes, live coding transforms what might otherwise be a source of anxiety into a collective, confidence-building experience.\nThere can be multiple approaches to teaching code and statistical data analysis, and some of these might improve or contribute to coding anxiety (link to chapter Sequential vs. Simultaneous: Approaches to Learning Programming and Statistics). Common wisdom also says that the first step is the hardest for any journey. In our experience, if students start with small, manageable, and clearly described tasks, their initial experience with coding will be positive, which will decrease anxiety levels when facing harder tasks. Therefore, we suggest that students are first given easy-to-follow tasks with step-by-step instructions, allowing confidence to grow. This is consistent with the strategy suggested by Auker and Barthelmess (2020). Later classes or assignments may contain less detailed guidance or be more open-ended, allowing students to explore their newfound confidence in their coding abilities at their own pace.",

    "text": "5.4 Support and Collaboration Beyond the Classroom\nCoding confidence often grows most effectively outside formal teaching time. Low-pressure practice, whether collaborative or individual, helps students reinforce skills and approach coding with curiosity rather than fear. Teachers can support this by structuring opportunities for independent study and peer interactions that sustain progress between classes. One simple but effective technique is to encourage students to maintain a short ‘coding diary’, allowing for normalisation of occasional frustration and celebration of key achievements.\nThe fear of revealing a lack of coding ability can be a powerful barrier, discouraging students from even attempting new exercises and progressing in their learning. Independent work outside the classroom, supported by additional materials, can help overcome this. Providing a list of such resources will help students realise that they can learn on their own and that it will give them a head start. In our experience, a particularly interesting resource comes via the R package swirl (https://swirlstats.com/). Swirl “teaches you R programming and data science interactively, at your own pace, and right in the R console!”. Contents can be explored independently, or by following the prompts of a ‘virtual tutor’ (link to generative AI chapter). Students are amused by a virtual tutor calling them by their name, meaning that they engage with the learning experience in a positive mood.\nSharing the learning journey with others can be equally powerful. The mantra “a problem shared is a problem halved” can be operationalised while teaching programming via pair-programming (Figure 5 + link to other chapters). Pair-programming might be a useful strategy to lower coding anxiety levels TODO missing REF Brougham et al. 2020. Nonetheless, these are not universal findings; see Krizsan and Lambic (2024) for a case where performance was apparently improved, but without a decrease in anxiety levels. Online pair-programming might be less intimidating for some students, although it is not clear whether the benefits associated with live pair-programming apply Hafeez et al. (2023).\nAI-assisted pair-programming, where a coder is paired with an AI agent, has become an accessible alternative. It could be used to the same effect as human-human pair-programming (Fan et al. 2025). This might be easier for students who would otherwise be reluctant to expose their difficulties to a colleague. Nonetheless, while AI-assisted pair-programming has been shown to enhance motivation, reduce anxiety, and even improve performance, it does not fully match the collaborative depth and social presence achieved through human-human pairing (Fan et al. 2025). TODO: is this meant to be the same reference? Regardless of the pair-programming mode considered, we believe that if well thought out and prepared, pair-programing activities can be used to lower coding anxiety levels in a range of students.\n\n\n\nFigure 5. Pair-programming can help lower one’s coding anxiety.\n\n\nStudents can be encouraged to further their learning journey by ‘teaming up’ with peers to continue to pair-programme outside of the classroom environment. It has been observed that this can assist with coding anxiety both through additional assistance in a familiar mode and also through the mechanism of shared endurance and a head-on approach to the anxiety barrier.\nUltimately, supporting learners beyond the classroom is about fostering autonomy and connection in equal measure. When students know they can access help, whether from peers, teachers, lecturers, or AI tools, they are less likely to interpret difficulties as personal failings. Instead, they begin to view coding as a shared and iterative process that need not come with coding anxiety but natural failure and success routines.",

    "text": "5.5 Key Takeaways\nCoding anxiety is real, especially for students for whom coding is a core part of their disciplinary focus. This barrier should be recognised, and we have a responsibility and opportunity to normalise it in teaching settings and explain why and how the anxiety cycle can be broken. Overcoming coding anxiety should be presented as a personal endeavour, but one that instructors and peers, along with a growing number of resources, will support. As a teacher, effective methods for breaking the anxiety cycle are as pedagogically important as content creation. Moreover, you will become an anxiety diffuser, starting by exploring ways to provide rewards from coding activities. In particular, activities allowing students to see the potential of coding to achieve tasks they are inherently interested in should be considered. Providing encouragement and additional resources for learning how to code, and promoting additional high-rewarding coding activities, are likely to help further. Strategies to share the burden, like pair-programming, could further boost self-confidence in coding. Overall, different audiences and topics will require slightly different approaches, so engaging with students and intervening using strategies discussed above will be fundamental for reducing coding anxiety and improving learning.",
