Programming or coding anxiety is defined as ‘a psychological state engendered when a student experiences or expects to lose self-esteem in confronting a computing situation’ [@Connolly2009]. Coding anxiety may be driven, in part, by other anxieties such as computer anxiety [@chua1999computer; @meinhardt2022computer] or statistics anxiety ([@Zeidner1991], amongst others. One may assume that “digital natives” [@Bennett2008] experience a lower level of computer anxiety; this assumption may not naturally translate to coding anxiety [@nolan2016role]. Indeed, computer anxiety could be attributed to, for example, variable exposure to coding and an over-reliance on connected digital ecosystems during childhood [@OECD2025]. The attribution of coding anxiety, however, is a more nuanced issue. Different levels of coding anxiety for mathematics and biomedical undergraduate students exist [@miller2024anxiety], with the former finding coding to be more enjoyable, and hence having lower anxiety levels, than the latter. More broadly, student identity and background can also contribute to anxiety-linked barriers to learning, such as gender [@forrester2022undergraduate] or learning in a non-native language [@kaur2024silent].

Given that coding anxiety can be attributed to a variety of sources [@pan2025conquering], here we draw on our collective experience of teaching coding, provide perspectives on coding anxiety, and offer strategies to mitigate it. We focus specifically on students for whom coding is not their core academic focus, but rather a necessary tool encountered when taking classes involving statistics, data analysis, experimental design, and modelling. It is possible that these students have had no prior exposure to coding, and their initial interactions will define their longer-term relationship with coding, and as a consequence, how they navigate an increasingly data-centric world where coding is an attractive, liberating, and increasingly essential skill.

## Recognising and Refocusing Anxiety

Anxiety sustains itself through a self-perpetuating cycle [@mkrtchian2017modeling]. It is believed to start with a trigger (e.g., a bad experience), which leads one to avoid future associated triggers in an attempt to feel some short-term relief [@hofmann2018rethinking]. However, such avoidance can lead to heightened anxiety in the long term [@mkrtchian2017modeling]. Since the brain learns that avoidance temporarily decreases anxiety, even if only momentarily, it may eventually prevent an individual from engaging with the trigger entirely. If the trigger is computer code, then coding becomes something to avoid, and hence coding anxiety is born. In contrast, confronting the trigger can build confidence and reduce anxiety over time **TODO: missing reference : Kampmannetal2019 ? **.


We believe that recognising learners’ coding anxieties upfront is an important first step towards demystifying it. Once students realise that this is an identified problem common to many, rather than something affecting them alone, they are one step closer to overcoming it. Humour, including self-deprecating jokes, describing how, despite now being the teacher, you once suffered from coding anxiety, can go a long way towards making students feel better. Cartoons may also be an effective way of making anxiety itself less daunting (Figure 1). If existing online content is not enough, and making cartoons is not one’s gift, AI-generated images could easily be created for that purpose - just make sure people have 5 fingers!

Given anxiety’s negative feedback loop, the best way to combat anxiety might be to break this vicious cycle (Figure 2). As an instructor or teacher, this can be achieved by providing positive experiences with coding. Importantly, after acknowledging that coding anxiety is real, the solutions should be presented along with how, as a teacher, overcoming their anxiety will be supported. For example, reflecting on their personal experience, the teacher could describe how they became at ease with coding. Such a role model could serve as a powerful catalyst for students to realise they can overcome their own coding anxiety too.

Gauging the class’s perception towards coding should prove useful in lowering overall anxiety. Collecting information about a priori fears or causes of anxiety related to one’s course, including - but not exclusively - coding anxiety, as well as course expectations, provides clues to what might be good strategies to adopt. In-class feedback tools like Mentimenter (www.mentimenter.com), allow students to provide feedback, anonymously and in real time, to make the course more accessible in an informal, friendly, and interactive way. This could generate useful ideas, including specific suggestions, for how to reduce anxiety. Additionally, having students reflect on how anxious they are about coding might allow them to identify shared problems and anxieties across the class.

## Building Confidence Through Active Learning

Early hands-on activities involving code, but not necessarily creating their own code, could prove beneficial by focusing on the end product rather than the means to get there. Even exercises where students simply copy-paste code, without knowing why it does what it does (but being told that later they will be able to code it themselves), could go a long way in reducing anxiety. Such exercises allow students to see how useful coding is for tasks they would like to do, but which would be impossible to do manually. Focusing on the outcomes students are interested in and can relate to makes them less reluctant to learn programming than if they just see it as a barrier. For example, one could take a couple of large datasets linked by a common variable, and ask students to examine the files in a text editor and “understand” the data. Then the students can be given code to produce a captivating visualisation (Figure 3) with relevant insights for the subject matter of their course. Focusing on the reward, rather than the trigger, can lower anxiety [@Xiao2022] and hopefully inspire students to create similar outputs themselves.

Having fun reduces anxiety in a wide variety of contexts, so why not try it for coding anxiety, too? Coding need not be boring! There are many resources that one can use to showcase how coding can be fun. Having fun coding will mean that when coding becomes required, students' receptivity to it is increased. R packages like `memer` and `mermery` allow meme creation from within R, while generative art packages can produce abstract paintings from code (Figure 4). The R package fun makes games and activities accessible from within the R environment. As an example, the classic game Minesweeper can be played within R via a single line of code defining the size of the area and the number of bombs. All the above can be used to introduce, in an informal setting, the concepts of functions and arguments. At the end of a long coding session, or even during one, package praise can also come in handy. A call to its single function `praise()` returns positive feedback like "You are wonderful!" or "You are supreme!". These simple statements often put a smile on students' faces, and based on our experience, that is halfway towards reducing anxiety. Finally, if students just can’t code but want to “fake it till they make it”, the R function `look_busy()` in the `player` package will produce output on the console that will make anyone else believe students are working hard. We have used several of these approaches and provide them as a starting point, but given R is a dynamic and ever-evolving environment, other fun and engaging options must live out there waiting to be used by teachers to help reduce code anxiety.

Live coding can be one of the most effective tools to demystify programming and reduce coding anxiety. When teachers write and run code in real time, narrating their thought process as they go (and getting error messages), they model both the practice and the mindset of coding. Students witness that even experienced coders make mistakes, encounter errors, and debug them systematically. This transparency transforms coding from a mysterious, high-stakes activity into a visible process of exploration, reasoning, and iteration.

Importantly, the approach taken during live coding matters as much as the content. Speaking aloud while typing, eg, explaining why particular commands are chosen, predicting outputs before running them, and pausing to invite student predictions, turns what might otherwise be a passive demonstration into an interactive learning experience. When an error appears, embrace it as an opportunity to model problem-solving, showing that mistakes are normal, and even useful. Seeing a tutor respond to an error message with curiosity rather than panic can profoundly reframe students’ emotional response to failure.

To lower anxiety further, live coding should begin with simple, visually rewarding tasks. Plot a small dataset, calculate a mean, or clean a short table. This way, students can follow the logic without feeling overwhelmed by syntax. Gradually, the exercises can build in complexity, moving from replication to modification and finally to creative application. When possible, students can be invited to suggest the next line of code, predict what will happen if a parameter is changed, or even take over the keyboard for short stretches.

Finally, recording or providing annotated versions of live coding sessions allows students to revisit material at their own pace. This ensures that the spontaneity of live teaching is complemented by the reassurance of reviewable, structured notes. By combining openness, interaction, and a healthy acceptance of mistakes, live coding transforms what might otherwise be a source of anxiety into a collective, confidence-building experience.

There can be multiple approaches to teaching code and statistical data analysis, and some of these might improve or contribute to coding anxiety (link to chapter Sequential vs. Simultaneous: Approaches to Learning Programming and Statistics). Common wisdom also says that the first step is the hardest for any journey. In our experience, if students start with small, manageable, and clearly described tasks, their initial experience with coding will be positive, which will decrease anxiety levels when facing harder tasks. Therefore, we suggest that students are first given easy-to-follow tasks with step-by-step instructions, allowing confidence to grow. This is consistent with the strategy suggested by @Auker2020. Later classes or assignments may contain less detailed guidance or be more open-ended, allowing students to explore their newfound confidence in their coding abilities at their own pace.

## Support and Collaboration Beyond the Classroom

Coding confidence often grows most effectively outside formal teaching time. Low-pressure practice, whether collaborative or individual, helps students reinforce skills and approach coding with curiosity rather than fear. Teachers can support this by structuring opportunities for independent study and peer interactions that sustain progress between classes. One simple but effective technique is to encourage students to maintain a short ‘coding diary’, allowing for normalisation of occasional frustration and celebration of key achievements.

The fear of revealing a lack of coding ability can be a powerful barrier, discouraging students from even attempting new exercises and progressing in their learning. Independent work outside the classroom, supported by additional materials, can help overcome this. Providing a list of such resources will help students realise that they can learn on their own and that it will give them a head start. In our experience, a particularly interesting resource comes via the R package `swirl` (https://swirlstats.com/). Swirl “teaches you R programming and data science interactively, at your own pace, and right in the R console!”. Contents can be explored independently, or by following the prompts of a ‘virtual tutor’ (link to generative AI chapter). Students are amused by a virtual tutor calling them by their name, meaning that they engage with the learning experience in a positive mood.

Sharing the learning journey with others can be equally powerful. The mantra “a problem shared is a problem halved” can be operationalised while teaching programming via pair-programming (Figure 5 + link to other chapters). Pair-programming might be a useful strategy to lower coding anxiety levels **TODO missing REF Brougham et al. 2020**. Nonetheless, these are not universal findings; see @Krizsan2024 for a case where performance was apparently improved, but without a decrease in anxiety levels. Online pair-programming might be less intimidating for some students, although it is not clear whether the benefits associated with live pair-programming apply @Hafeez2023.

AI-assisted pair-programming, where a coder is paired with an AI agent, has become an accessible alternative. It could be used to the same effect as human-human pair-programming [@Fan2025]. This might be easier for students who would otherwise be reluctant to expose their difficulties to a colleague. Nonetheless, while AI-assisted pair-programming has been shown to enhance motivation, reduce anxiety, and even improve performance, it does not fully match the collaborative depth and social presence achieved through human-human pairing [@Fan2025]. **TODO: is this meant to be the same reference?** Regardless of the pair-programming mode considered, we believe that if well thought out and prepared, pair-programing activities can be used to lower coding anxiety levels in a range of students.

![Figure 5. Pair-programming can help lower one’s coding anxiety.](images/statsanx_pair.png)

Students can be encouraged to further their learning journey by ‘teaming up’ with peers to continue to pair-programme outside of the classroom environment. It has been observed that this can assist with coding anxiety both through additional assistance in a familiar mode and also through the mechanism of shared endurance and a head-on approach to the anxiety barrier.

Ultimately, supporting learners beyond the classroom is about fostering autonomy and connection in equal measure. When students know they can access help, whether from peers, teachers, lecturers, or AI tools, they are less likely to interpret difficulties as personal failings. Instead, they begin to view coding as a shared and iterative process that need not come with coding anxiety but natural failure and success routines.

## Key Takeaways

Coding anxiety is real, especially for students for whom coding is a core part of their disciplinary focus. This barrier should be recognised, and we have a responsibility and opportunity to normalise it in teaching settings and explain why and how the anxiety cycle can be broken. Overcoming coding anxiety should be presented as a personal endeavour, but one that instructors and peers, along with a growing number of resources, will support. As a teacher, effective methods for breaking the anxiety cycle are as pedagogically important as content creation. Moreover, you will become an anxiety diffuser, starting by exploring ways to provide rewards from coding activities. In particular, activities allowing students to see the potential of coding to achieve tasks they are inherently interested in should be considered. Providing encouragement and additional resources for learning how to code, and promoting additional high-rewarding coding activities, are likely to help further. Strategies to share the burden, like pair-programming, could further boost self-confidence in coding. Overall, different audiences and topics will require slightly different approaches, so engaging with students and intervening using strategies discussed above will be fundamental for reducing coding anxiety and improving learning.
